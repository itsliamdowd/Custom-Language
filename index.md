## Make a Custom Programming Language using Python!

This project is an attempt at making a programming language using python. Although it's basic so far, I think this project can definetly be expanded on and has a lot of room to grow from. The syntax is heavilly influenced by Python, Javascript, and Swift, making it easy to use and more beginner-friendly. The majority of the changes I made were changes that I wanted to see be made to all three languages and combining the aspects that I liked from each language for varius reasons.

### Syntax

In this section, you will learn about the basic syntax of how to use the language

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SkiingIsFun123/Custom-Language/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
